# Spherical Harmonics

A recreation of [the diagram on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spherical_Harmonics.png) by [Inigo Quilez](http://www.iquilezles.org/). The original figure is — quite a bit more impressively — ray-traced directly on the GPU in real time, from scratch on every frame. The work here is computed on the CPU as deformations of an icosphere mesh, then rendered on the GPU.
