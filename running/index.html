So much air here. A run.</p><h3>1<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>5 x 1 mile with 200m moving rest. 5:18, 5:16, 5:14, 5:07, 5:01. Trying to drill this pace into my head/legs. Felt super slow and heavy, which I guess is better than feeling good but having run really slowly.</p><h3>1<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>6 mile tempo. 5:19-5:20-5:16-5:17-5:25-5:25. Guessing on the last two since my workout partner with the GPS sped up and since I couldn‚Äôt hold the pace and instead just tried to keep it reasonable. Always just glad to get in a workout.</p><h3>1<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Just a run.</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>On the track. 3 x 1 mile with 200m rest + 2 x 800m. Which is to say, I couldn‚Äôt keep up with my workout partner on those last two miles. 5:02, 4:55, 4:55. He finished it up in 4:52, 4:44, which is just darned impressive. For how I‚Äôve been feeling and how much I‚Äôve been running, I was still happy enough with it. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Just a morning run.</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->7<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>A run. It was nice. Not feeling the need to offer more details than that today.</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->4<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Wednesday morning workout. A bit of a sore knee for the last week or two, but got it done. 3 mile repeats with 200m rest. 5:21, 5:15, 5:05. Then 2 x 400m. 1:10, 1:06. Felt very relaxed; just didn‚Äôt <em>feel</em> like doing more today. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->7<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Still mostly not running, but we got these Wednesday workouts. 4.25 miles total (5:26-5:23-5:20-5:17-1:20).</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Haven‚Äôt run since Saturday. Almost just bailed. Did a 10K on the track instead. 33:18 total (5:26-5:25-5:19-5:19-5:16-5:19-1:12). Felt great. Totally just cruising without excessive effort. Finished and wanted to do more.</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->6<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Morning tempo. 5:28-5:26-5:22-5:26-5:23-5:19. Felt like a real grind, but held it together, so‚Ä¶ a success?</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Workout with the club. 5:12, 5:03, 5:01. Workoutmates finished with a 4:55. I stopped after three. Was tightening up. Wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to hold a decent pace. Still content. It‚Äôs slowly starting to feel more natural to run fast.</p><h3>1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Lake loop. 6 miles. Easy/moderate. And some canine sprints.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Morning run in the hills. Took it pretty easy. 7 miles or so, maybe.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>6am lake laps with the club and a mile or two with the little one. Big success to be getting out the door these days.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->6<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Track workout. 5 x 1 mile. 5:35, 5:28, 5:19, 5:14, 5:08. Definitely still dusting off the cobwebs (and still a little sore from long run) but maybe getting it back a little? I don‚Äôt know. Still assuming most of the battle is just forcing it for now and then maybe it‚Äôll feel alright in another month or two.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Long run with the club. 16 miles total, I think? Some good hills in there. Pretty sore from it. Have started getting back into the long runs recently, but bringing back some effort was a nice change.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->2<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Another run with the track club. Lost count of the laps, but maybe 9-10 miles by the time I finished running with the canine. Knee is just a bit sore. Should probably back off before I hurt myself.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Solid workout with the local track club. Like fifteen miles by the time I did some sprint-n-sniffs with the furry one. 8 miles tempo-ish pace (5:45-5:55 maybe?). Felt pretty good, but gonna be a little sore and need some recovery after that.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Borderline workout. Two lake laps which amounts to about 8.75 total. No time on it, but I think it was mostly in the 5:45-6:00 min/mi range. So like not quite a proper workout, but sure felt good. Little sore. Otherwise feels great to be slowly getting back into it.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Workout. Fast tempo (with pee breaks) with the canine unit, then 2 x 1 mile on the track. 4:56, 4:56. Knee felt just fine. Encouraged that it didn‚Äôt feel perfect but at least felt much better than it has been lately.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Workout. 4 x 1 mile with 400m moving rest. 5:29, 5:22, 5:17, 5:09. So it sped up at least, but certainly didn‚Äôt feel easy like I hoped. Sometimes you just have to force it and wait for the day when it feels good. Hopefully.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->2<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Run with the dog and then 2 miles on the track (5:14-5:15). I conclude two things: 1) stopping abruptly to sniff trees is hard on human knees, and 2) I probably shouldn‚Äôt start workouts with a dog-based tempo run if I want the track portion to be high-value.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Run with the dog. He‚Äôs kickin‚Äô my butt. About 3 miles pretty hard.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Intended to do a track workout but woke up too late so just ran. 55 minutes or so. Maybe 8 miles? Tried to get it rolling toward the later section, with mixed success. I really shouldn‚Äôt stray into the no-man‚Äôs-land between easy runs and actual workouts, but when your training is generally kinda crap, go with it I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><img src="images/run.jpg" alt="A run"/><p>Long run. First in a loong time. 1:50. Maybe 2500 ft up and down. Feeling it this afternoon.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->7<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Blah run. Felt pretty horrible. Ballpark 5.5 miles maybe?</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Track workout. 4 miles (5:28-5:29-5:29-5:25) + 1 mile (5:03). Had to force it, but wasn‚Äôt entirely dissatisfied that I can at least still cruise around the track for a while, even if we‚Äôve got a whole lot of work ahead in order to claw our way back. 10 miles total, give or take.</p><h3>9<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><img src="images/clouds.jpg" alt="Clouds"/><p>77 minute run in the hills and with ~2000ft of elevation gain. Longest run in a while.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Morning run in the hills, followed with some brief but intense sprints with the dog. 1700ft up/down, which is always a plus. Feeling a bit more natural with a bit more regularity.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Hardly a workout. Couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do a whole workout so just did a single mile on the track with just a bit of running. 4:57 for a mile. Didn‚Äôt feel too bad, but still a struggle overall just to get out the door.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><img src="images/rays.jpg" alt="Anticrepuscular Rays"/><p>A run in the hills with 1600ft up and down. A struggle lately to stay on the train and not just skip runs.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->2<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Some short runs in the mean time, but back on the track for an evening workout. 2 miles (5:22-5:26) + 1 mile (5:12). Wanted to do more. Still not feeling great, but I view it as getting the mediocre workouts out of the way so that we can get back to some good workouts.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->6<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>A run with the dog, then a bit on the track and then 3 miles back home. 5K on the track in 16:51 (5:29, 5:24, 5:20, 0:38). I‚Äôm sore and this pace isn‚Äôt feeling as easy as it needs to, but it‚Äôs a good start just to be on the track at all.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>Morning semi-run with the dog. Mostly sniffing.</p><h3>8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->4<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><img src="images/freycinet.jpg" alt="Running"/><p>Well we obviously haven‚Äôt done a good job of logging the running here. We‚Äôve had some pretty great runs and as much as a couple weeks without really much running at all. This hasn‚Äôt been going according to plan, but then I guess the plan wasn‚Äôt really to stick to a rigorous plan.</p><p>But today? Today was the first workout on a track in a long time. 10:19 for two miles (5:11-5:08). I‚Äôm a bit sore today but glad to know I can still move around a track at an alright speed. Going to try to repeat that soon.</p><h3>4<!-- -->/<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>2 x mile + 1 x 400. Short workout. 5:18, 5:15, 66. Feeling better than I thought maybe, but still not feeling particularly fast or effortless. Lots of work ahead if the Achilles will play along. 7 miles total.</p><h3>4<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>3.17 mile tempo in 17:48 for an average pace of 5:36/mi. 4.75 miles total. Not bad. Good route. Room for consistent repetition and improvement.</p><h3>4<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>6 mile hike. +/- 2400 ft.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>5.5 miles. 3 x 1 mile on the track with 1:30 rest. 5:16, 5:17, 5:05. First thing approaching a workout in a long time. Nothing gets the lead out quite like the last 400m of your mile repeats coinciding with the first 600m of a high school team‚Äôs workout. Didn‚Äôt feel effortless, but maybe there‚Äôs hope.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->3<!-- -->0<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>6.67 miles. Hill loop. 1845 ft up and down. 55:04 total. 24:25 up, 30:39 down.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->9<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>8 miles. Moderate run with one mile on the track in the middle of the run. 5:17 (80-81-79-77). Felt tough. Knew getting the train started wasn‚Äôt gonna be pleasant.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->8<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><img src="images/el1.png" alt="Elevation profile"/><p><em>Morning</em>: 6.67 miles. ~50-55 minutes. Easy/moderate pace. 1845 ft up, 1845 ft down. Third day running in a row. Which is a big deal lately. üéâ</p><p><em>Evening</em>: 4.75 miles. Untimed. Need to not overdo it.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->7<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>7.75 miles. Moderately hard at times. Untimed.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->6<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>4.75 miles. Untimed.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->5<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>11 mile hike.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->3<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>4.75 miles. Untimed. Achilles pain subsided a bit after two miles.</p><h3>3<!-- -->/<!-- -->2<!-- -->1<!-- -->/<!-- -->1<!-- -->8</h3><p>4.75 miles. Untimed. I‚Äôm still in alright shape, but I haven‚Äôt run in a couple weeks and I haven‚Äôt done a structured workout in months. I decided on three goals this morning:</p><ol><li>Local marathon in late-March <!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->.</li><li>Sub-<!-- -->5<!-- -->0<!-- --> minutes for <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- --> miles</li><li>Log workouts</li></ol><p>
